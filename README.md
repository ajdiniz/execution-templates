# senhasegura Execution Templates

## Executions module

Many senhasegura features need to perform asynchronous tasks on devices. They run with standard protocols or interfaces that senhasegura can, over its plugins, easily manage.

Facing this, the senhasegura Execution module will centralize all operations.

## Execution Templates

Templates are essential components of the [senhasegura Execution module](https://docs.senhasegura.io/docs/3.22/automated-operations/overview). They are the step-by-step instructions to perform system changes such as password changes, enabling/disabling credentials, creating/deleting groups, and lots of automation.
